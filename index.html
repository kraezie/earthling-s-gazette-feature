            Participation among youth begins at home. Youngster picks up their initial knowledge ofhygiene, water and energy usage, gardening, and other topics at home. In order to help children, become more responsible for preserving the environment and natural resources, parents and families have a duty to instill in them good habits and teach them how to keep things clean and use resources wisely, including electricity, water, and other resources.Youth today have greater obligations to their own nation. We need to live with hope for a better tomorrow and take lessons from the past. We can draw lessons from the past. Youth are not only the leaders of tomorrow but also good followers of today, they are a crucial segment of a nationâ€™s development. Their contribution, therefore, is highly needed. Different youth organizations have led this part around the globe and can promote making the environment cleaner and greener.Essentially, the environment includes everything that surrounds us, including both living organisms and inanimate objects. Youth are the youthful people. The topic of environmental protection is very broad, problems are getting worse daily, and everyone is worried about climate change and global warming as global environmental issues are more of a concern than local and national ones.Protecting the environment starts with pollution control therefore, youth can help reduce waste by paying attention to minor details in their daily lives, for example, not taking extra plastic bags when they go shopping.

            In the study about youth development towards the green environment (Shashi Punam & Madhu Bala), the main objectives of their study are to study the role of the Youth in a cleaner as well as greener environment and to find the mission of the community in helping to achieve a sustainable environment.

            Youth participation starts from home. It is very true that youth is a role model to start from home. He/ She is taken as an exemplary figure or icon of his house by his/ her brothers, sisters, and other family members. If we take a simple example, we can use dustbins to manage household rubbish. We can dig a pit to dispose of the organic waste and prepare compost. This compost can be further used to promote soil productivity and grow healthy foods. This simple example makes clear how a youth can persuade and motivate every member of his house to proper sanitation. Some roles of the youths in pursuing environmental sustainability are:

            Inspiring, Awaking, and Motivating Role in the Community, initiating role by starting the cleaning, plantation campaigns, etc.,and Exemplary role by being an example of eco-friendly acts like reducing, reusing, recycling, using bins, etc.

            So, in conclusion, we may just say that it is up to us to take care of the planet. The method we should begin taking care of the environment in our own backyards. Youth can educate others by instructing pupils on the value of a green environment and how to maintain a healthy, green environment through educational initiatives, cleaning efforts, athletic initiatives, workshops, and campaigns since distributing information among students involves informing their friends, family, and across the entire neighborhood. The greatest method to combat potentially hit communities is to raise awareness of environmental problems, such as climate change.
